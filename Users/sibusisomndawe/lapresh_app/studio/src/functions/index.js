// This file is likely a leftover or template.
// The actual Cloud Functions entry point for TypeScript projects
// is usually src/functions/lib/index.js, which is generated
// from src/functions/index.ts during the build process.

// If you have specific JavaScript functions you want to deploy alongside
// TypeScript functions, you can add them here, but ensure your
// firebase.json and package.json configurations correctly
// account for both TypeScript compilation and direct JavaScript deployment.

// For a purely TypeScript setup where index.ts is your source,
// this file can usually be empty or removed, as long as
// "main" in src/functions/package.json points to "lib/index.js".
